# https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/
# Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. The function should find all quadruplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional array of all these quadruplets in no particular order.
# If no four numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

# Sample Input, array = [7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2] , targetSum = 16
# Sample Output [[7, 6, 4, -1], [7, 6, 1, 2]] // the quadruplets could be ordered differently

def four_sum(nums, target); end
